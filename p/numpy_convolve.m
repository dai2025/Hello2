numpy_convolve

In this blog post, I will show you how to use numpy.convolve function to perform discrete linear convolution of two one-dimensional arrays. Convolution is a mathematical operation that is often used in signal processing, image processing, and neural networks. It can be understood as sliding one array over another and multiplying them element-wise at each position.

To use numpy.convolve, we need to pass two arrays as arguments, and optionally a mode parameter that specifies how to handle the boundary cases. The default mode is 'full', which returns the convolution at each point of overlap, even if the arrays do not overlap completely. The output shape of 'full' mode is (N+M-1,), where N and M are the lengths of the input arrays.

For example, let's convolve two arrays X and Y:

X = [1, 2, 3]
Y = [0, 1, 0.5]

Z = np.convolve(X, Y)
print(Z)
# [0.  1.  2.5 4.  1.5]

The output Z is an array of length 5, which is the sum of N and M minus one. We can see how Z is computed by reversing Y and sliding it over X:

[3 2 1]    [0   1   0.5]
[0   1   0.5]    [3 2 1] = 0 * 3 + 1 * 2 + 0.5 * 1 = 2.5
    [0   1   0.5]    [3 2 1] = 0 * 2 + 1 * 3 + 0.5 * 2 = 4

The other modes are 'same' and 'valid'. The 'same' mode returns output of length max(N, M), and the 'valid' mode returns output of length max(N, M) - min(N, M) + 1. The 'same' mode preserves the center alignment of the input arrays, while the 'valid' mode only returns the convolution where the input arrays overlap completely.
