In this blog post, I will show you how to use the _CrtDbg library to detect and debug memory leaks in C++. Memory leaks are a common problem in C++ programs, where dynamically allocated memory is not freed properly. This can lead to performance degradation, memory exhaustion, and unexpected behavior.

The _CrtDbg library provides several macros and functions to help you track and report memory leaks. The most important ones are:

- _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC: This macro enables the debug heap functions and maps the standard malloc and free functions to their debug versions. You should define this macro before including any header files that use malloc or free.

- _CrtSetDbgFlag: This function sets the debug flag for the current process. The flag controls how the debug heap functions behave. You can use bitwise OR to combine different options, such as _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF (turn on debug allocation) and _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF (perform automatic leak checking at program exit).

- DBG_NEW: This macro replaces the new operator with a debug version that records the file name and line number of each allocation. You should use this macro instead of new whenever possible.

- _CrtDumpMemoryLeaks: This function dumps all the memory blocks in the debug heap to a report file. You can use this function to manually check for memory leaks at any point in your program.

- _CrtSetReportMode: This function sets the reporting mode for a given report type. The report types are _CRT_WARN, _CRT_ERROR, and _CRT_ASSERT. The reporting modes are _CRTDBG_MODE_FILE (write to a file), _CRTDBG_MODE_DEBUG (send to debugger), _CRTDBG_MODE_WNDW (display in a message box), or _CRTDBG_MODE_FILE | _CRTDBG_MODE_DEBUG (write to a file and send to debugger).

- _CrtSetBreakAlloc: This function sets an allocation number that will cause a breakpoint in the debugger. You can use this function to find out where a specific memory block was allocated.

- _CrtMemState: This structure holds information about the state of the debug heap at a given point. You can use this structure to compare and report memory usage between two points in your program.

- _CrtMemCheckpoint: This function takes a snapshot of the current state of the debug heap and stores it in a _CrtMemState structure.

- _CrtMemDifference: This function compares two _CrtMemState structures and stores the difference in a third one. You can use this function to find out how much memory was allocated or freed between two points in your program.

- _CrtMemDumpStatistics: This function dumps the statistics of a given _CrtMemState structure to a report file. You can use this function to see how many blocks and bytes of each type (_NORMAL_BLOCK, _CLIENT_BLOCK, etc.) are in the debug heap.

To use these functions and macros, you need to include <crtdbg.h> in your source files. Here is an example of how to use them:

```cpp
#define _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <crtdbg.h>

#ifdef _DEBUG
#define DBG_NEW new ( _NORMAL_BLOCK , __FILE__ , __LINE__ )
// Replace _NORMAL_BLOCK with _CLIENT_BLOCK if you want the
// allocations to be of _CLIENT_BLOCK type
#else
#define DBG_NEW new
#endif

_CrtSetDbgFlag ( _CRTDBG_ALLOC_MEM_DF | _CRTDBG_LEAK_CHECK_DF );
//_CrtDumpMemoryLeaks();
//_CrtSetReportMode( _CRT_WARN, _CRTDBG_MODE_DEBUG );

////_CrtSetBreakAlloc(20);

//_CrtMemState s1;
//_CrtMemCheckpoint( &s1 );

_CrtMemCheckpoint( &s1 );
// memory allocations take place here
_CrtMemCheckpoint( &s2 );

if ( _CrtMemDifference( &s3, &s1, &s2) )
_CrtMemDumpStatistics( &s3 );
```

In this example, we first define the _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC macro and include <crtdbg.h>. Then we define the DBG_NEW macro to replace new with its debug version. Next, we set the debug flag to enable
