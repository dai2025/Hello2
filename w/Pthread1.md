In this blog post, I will show you how to use **pthread** and **windows** libraries to create and manipulate mutexes in C++. Mutexes are useful for synchronizing access to shared resources, such as files or memory. I will also write some sample code to demonstrate how to use mutexes in practice.

First, let's include the necessary headers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <assert.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <windows.h>
```

Next, let's declare a global variable for a pthread mutex and initialize it:

```cpp
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
```

We can use the `pthread_lock` and `pthread_unlock` functions to acquire and release the mutex, respectively. For example, if we want to print something to the standard output, we can do something like this:

```cpp
pthread_lock(&mutex);
std::cout << "Hello from thread " << pthread_self() << std::endl;
pthread_unlock(&mutex);
```

This way, we can ensure that only one thread can write to the standard output at a time, and avoid interleaving or garbling the output.

Similarly, we can use the `windows` library to create and manipulate a mutex object for Windows threads. We can use the `CreateMutex` function to create a mutex object and get a handle to it:

```cpp
HANDLE hIOMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, FALSE, NULL);
```

The first parameter is a security attribute, which we can set to NULL for default. The second parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether the calling thread should own the mutex initially. The third parameter is a name for the mutex object, which we can set to NULL for anonymous.

We can use the `WaitForSingleObject` function to wait for the mutex object to be signaled, which means it is available for ownership. The function returns when the calling thread owns the mutex object. The first parameter is the handle to the mutex object, and the second parameter is a timeout value in milliseconds. We can use `INFINITE` to wait indefinitely.

```cpp
WaitForSingleObject(hIOMutex, INFINITE);
```

We can use the `ReleaseMutex` function to release ownership of the mutex object and signal it for other threads:

```cpp
ReleaseMutex(hIOMutex);
```

For example, if we want to write something to a file, we can do something like this:

```cpp
WaitForSingleObject(hIOMutex, INFINITE);
fseek(fp, desired_position, 0L);
fwrite(data, sizeof(data), 1, fp);
ReleaseMutex(hIOMutex);
```

This way, we can ensure that only one thread can write to the file at a time, and avoid overwriting or corrupting the data.

Here is some sample code that creates two threads using pthread and windows libraries, and uses mutexes to synchronize their output:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <assert.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <windows.h>

pthread_mutex_t mutex;
HANDLE hIOMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, FALSE, NULL);

void* pthread_func(void* arg) {
pthread_lock(&mutex);
std::cout << "Hello from pthread " << pthread_self() << std::endl;
pthread_unlock(&mutex);
return NULL;
}

DWORD WINAPI windows_func(LPVOID arg) {
WaitForSingleObject(hIOMutex, INFINITE);
std::cout << "Hello from windows thread " << GetCurrentThreadId() << std::endl;
ReleaseMutex(hIOMutex);
return 0;
}

int main()
{
pthread_t pt;
HANDLE wt;

pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);

pthread_create(&pt, NULL, pthread_func, NULL);
wt = CreateThread(NULL, 0, windows_func, NULL , 0 ,NULL);

pthread_join(pt, NULL);
WaitForSingleObject(wt , INFINITE);

pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
CloseHandle(wt);

return 0;
}
```
